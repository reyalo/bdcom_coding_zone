This table explains how FIFO (named pipes) behave in different scenarios when performing open(), read(), or write() operations. Here's a simplified explanation:

1. open() Behavior
Opening FIFO for Read-Only (O_RDONLY):

If another process has opened the FIFO for writing, open() succeeds immediately.
If no process has opened the FIFO for writing, open() blocks (waits) until a writer opens the FIFO.
Opening FIFO for Write-Only (O_WRONLY):

If another process has opened the FIFO for reading, open() succeeds immediately.
If no process has opened the FIFO for reading, open() blocks (waits) until a reader opens the FIFO.
Using O_NONBLOCK:

If O_NONBLOCK is set, open() does not block:
For O_RDONLY: It succeeds even if no writer exists.
For O_WRONLY: It fails with an error (ENXIO) if no reader exists.
2. read() Behavior
Reading from an Empty FIFO:

If a writer exists, read() blocks (waits) until data is written to the FIFO.
If no writer exists, read() returns 0 (end-of-file).
Using O_NONBLOCK:

If O_NONBLOCK is set and the FIFO is empty:
read() returns an error (EAGAIN) instead of blocking.
3. write() Behavior
Writing to a FIFO:
If a reader exists, write() succeeds.
If no reader exists, the process receives a SIGPIPE signal, and write() fails.
Key Takeaways:
Blocking Behavior:

open(), read(), and write() on FIFOs can block (wait) depending on whether a corresponding reader or writer exists.
Use O_NONBLOCK to avoid blocking.
Errors:

ENXIO: No reader exists when opening for write-only with O_NONBLOCK.
EAGAIN: FIFO is empty when reading with O_NONBLOCK.
End-of-File (read() returns 0):

Happens when there are no writers, and the FIFO is empty.
Example Scenarios:
Reader Opens First:

open(O_RDONLY) blocks until a writer opens the FIFO.
Writer Opens First:

open(O_WRONLY) blocks until a reader opens the FIFO.
Reader Reads an Empty FIFO:

Blocks until data is written, or returns 0 if no writer exists.
Writer Writes Without a Reader:

Fails with SIGPIPE.
This behavior ensures synchronization between processes using FIFOs. Let me know if you need further clarification!
